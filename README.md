Ever been hungry but wanted some company, or just some good food and conversation? Are all of your friends busy during your lunch hours? Maybe there is a new place you want to try in your area but your tastebuds are more adventurous than the people you would usually eat out with? Good news…We’re here to help!

Foodtroverts is a platform built with the intention of bringing people together, everyone has to eat so why not add some company? Often times people associate food with dating - so we are here to get rid of that stigma. However - new friends, great experiences, networking, and maybe a new mate…it’s ALL welcomed here after a good meal!
